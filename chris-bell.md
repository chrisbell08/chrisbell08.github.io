*I'm an experienced developer currently working for Purpose Media in Derby*

I have experience in many Front End Technologies including SASS, Javascript, JQuer & Grunt. I also have a lot of experience with the PHP framework Laravel. 

CMS wise I do a lot of work with WordPress and Perch.

When not working I like to level up my skills using Treehouse. I also like to listen to podcasts such as the Shop Talk Show, Codepen Radio, The Web Ahead and Boagworld.
